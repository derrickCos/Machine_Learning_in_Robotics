There are 8 code files in the zip.
1. If you want to check MDP section, please run 'run_FrozenLake.py' directly. The default grid is 4*4, in order to speed up the convergence process, if you want to run the frozen lake with 8*8 size, please change below argumets in the 'run_FrozenLake.py', from line 114 to 122, set step size as 1000, iteration time as 500, and horizaon as 30. 

2. I choose Cart - pole problem. Please run 'run_pgo_continuous.py' directly. Sorry for bad performance in this section, but you can still see the cart - pole figure as well as iteration results. My modification locates from line 112 to line 134.

Thanks for your time!
