Package Execution
-----------------
Execute the 'UKF.py', please make sure all test data store in a folder with the same directory as my code files. For each test IMU data, you are supposed to see a figure display on the screen to show filter result in roll, pitch and yaw. Once you close the figure, it will filter next test data in the folder automatically. 

Image stitching to build panorama
---------------------------------
The stitch image code 'img_stitch.py' in Python version will cost about 30 mins to generate one panorama, if you want to check the process, please run Matlab version 'img_stitch.m', they are both written via the same algorithm.
